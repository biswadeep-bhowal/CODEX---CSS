        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
        standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make
        a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
        remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
        Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
        of Lorem Ipsum.

    <p class="secondParagraph">
        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at
        its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as
        opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing
        packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum'
        will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by
        accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

        On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized
        by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble
        that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which
        is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to
        distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able
        to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances
        and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to
        be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of
        selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse
        pains.
